In step 4, all agents switched to blue again\n5. In step 5, all agents switched back to red\n\nThis creates an oscillating pattern where:\n- All agents move in unison\n- They alternate between red and blue each step\n- Each agent makes their choice based on trying to \"balance\" with their neighbor's previous choice\n- The pattern appears to be stuck in an infinite loop of red \u2192 blue \u2192 red \u2192 blue...\n\nNo stable equilibrium is reached because all agents are simultaneously reacting to each other's previous choices, leading to synchronized flipping between colors. This demonstrates emergent collective behavior where individual attempts to balance with neighbors paradoxically creates system-wide oscillation.\n\nThis is likely not the intended outcome if the goal was to achieve a stable balanced distribution of colors. A more effective strategy might involve some agents maintaining their colors across rounds or incorporating more information than just their immediate neighbor's last choice.",
